# A crowd-sourced list of Independent takeout places

Everything's a little scary right now. Many folks who can stay inside and limit exposure are doing so, either voluntarily or due to government decree. 

Folks who are staying in can continue to support independent businesses by ordering takeaway/takeout/delivery. Please add your fav local delivery places and remember to tip well and limit exposure for your delivery drivers.

Is it safe to eat takeout?
---------
[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-how-get-food-safely/608008/) asked experts who say largely, yes. However, they warn that delivery drivers are at higher risk. Please tip well and give folks delivering your food ways to deliver that don't involved interacting with you.

To create your own local list
----------
Please use the format COUNTRYABBREVIATION-City.md to create a new markdown file for your area and submit it as a pull request. Feel free to make categories for popular area types of food. 

Countries that may have multiple cities with the same name (looking at you, USA), please use the format COUNTRYABBREVIATION-STATEABBREVIATION-city.md, for example. USA-NC-Washington.md would cover little Washington NC, which USA-IL-Washington.md would work for Washington Illinois.

To add a listing
-------
Please add the listing as an unordered bullet point listing first the name of the resturant, then a short description. Then list their delivery area and details. Here's an example:

* [Mr Singh's Pizza](http://www.mrsinghspizza.co.uk/): All vegeterian pizza. Delivery areas cover from Handworth to Bham city center and West Bromwich. Call them to order.
