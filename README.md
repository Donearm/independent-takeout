# A crowd-sourced list of Independent takeout places

Everything's a little scary right now. Many folks who can stay inside and limit exposure are doing so, either voluntarily or due to government decree. 

Folks who are staying in can continue to support independent businesses by ordering takeaway/takeout/delivery. Please add your fav local delivery places and remember to tip well and limit exposure for your delivery drivers.
