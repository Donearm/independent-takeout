Indian
-------
* [Aniseed](http://aniseedcanarywharf.co.uk): Decent Indian dishes located not far from Canary Wharf (on Westferry Road). Fantastic vegetarian dishes and great service. Delivery fee seems to be incorporated into the food cost as there's a discount for collection orders.

Pizza
-----
* [Theo's](https://www.theospizzeria.com/): Located in Elephant & Castle and Camberwell. In my opinion the best neopolitan-style pizza in London üçï. Delivery via Deliveroo
